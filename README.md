# PLAYSTORE-DATA-ANALYSIS
i am going to do EDA and Visualisaion on playstore data and its user reviews dataset. 

1. App performance analysis: The performance of an app on the Play Store can be analyzed by tracking metrics such as downloads, ratings, reviews, and user retention. This data can be used to understand the popularity and user engagement of an app, and to identify areas of improvement.

2. App Store Optimization (ASO): ASO is the process of optimizing app metadata such as app title, description, keywords, and images to improve the visibility and ranking of an app on the Play Store. App analysis tools can help in identifying the right keywords and optimizing the metadata to increase app visibility.

3. User behavior analysis: Understanding user behavior on the Play Store can help in improving app engagement and retention. This can be done by analyzing user reviews, ratings, and feedback, and by identifying the most popular features of the app.

4. Market trends analysis: App analysis tools can help in identifying market trends such as popular app categories, user demographics, and app revenue. This information can be used to make informed decisions about app development and marketing strategies.
